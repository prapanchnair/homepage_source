I am a Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Science, pursuing research on Numerical methods for solving fluid flow problems. As part of PhD research, I have built a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics program that can solve internal flows, free surface flows, interface flows and Fluid Structure Interaction problems. The code is now being prepared for open source hosting. My research interests, code downloads etc., can be found here. Feel free to explore my views on philosophy, art and research in the blog section. Please feel free to contact me at <br>
